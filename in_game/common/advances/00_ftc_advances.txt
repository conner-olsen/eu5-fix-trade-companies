# NOTE: For some reason, replace is not sufficient here. If done, the changes will be reflected in the advance,
# but not the building requirements. Further, the file name matters too, as if it is alphabetically after
# the original game file, then the same issue occurs, where the change is reflected in the advance,
# but not the buildings. There must be some setup going on where this is calculated with the first file loaded.
